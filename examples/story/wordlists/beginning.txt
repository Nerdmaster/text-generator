It was a dark and {{adjective}} night.  I was so {{adjective}} I almost peed my pants as I stared at the fire.
Well, the weather outside was {{adjective}}, but inside it was so {{adjective}} that I just sat by the fire.
Sitting {{in front of|near|beside|precisely three feet south of}} a {{verbing}} fire, I warmed my {{adjective}} body while the storm outside raged on.
Call me {{malename}}.  Or Queequeg, I don't really care.  The point is, there was a fire inside my {{noun}} and it kept me warmer than if I were out in the {{adjective}} rain, okay?!?
