The Prince and the Peasant
=====

It was a dark and {{adjective}} night, and the beautiful peasant girl,
{{femalename->$girl}}, slipped and fell.  Luckily for her, Prince
{{malename->$boy}} was in the near vicinity...



Prince {{$boy}}: Wow, that looked pretty painful.  Are you all right?

{{$girl}}: Well, I'm a bit dirty, and I {{verbed}} my dress, but I think I'll
manage.  Thanks though.

Prince {{$boy}}: Well, I can't just leave you here like this.  You will come
with me to my castle, and you can dry off and change your {{nouns}} if you wish.
But I can't leave you to {{verb}} all alone!

{{$girl}}: Oh, I don't know...  I'm supposed to be out gathering fruits and
{{foods}}, and my father will be expecting me back very soon.

Prince {{$boy}}: But you must!  I could not bear to leave here without you.
You see, I have been in love with you since I first laid eyes on you.

{{$girl}}: How exciting!  Then you must be--

Prince {{$boy}}: That's right, I'm {{$boy}}, Prince of {{place}}, and I've
spent the last {{number}} years looking for you again.  Will you marry me,
{{femalename->$othergirl}}?

{{$girl}}: Uh... you know, I'd like to, but you see, I'm {{$girl}}.  I think
you're looking for my sister, the lady {{$othergirl}}.

Prince {{$boy}}: True enough, I thought you were her.  No matter, you were my
second choice anyhow.  Follow me!

{{$girl}}: Well, my husband would probably disapprove, but okay!



Back at the castle, the prince makes his move...



Prince {{$boy}} (in a very {{adjective}} tone): Well, {{$girl}}, are
you... {{adjective}}?

{{$girl}}: No, not really. The way you keep {{verbing}} me with your eyes is a
little bit creepy, and I don't think your "it's too hot, so I'm gonna just take
off my {{noun}}" speech is very amusing at all.

Prince {{$boy}}: I see.  Well, perhaps some wine or {{liquid}} would make you
feel better?  Are you hungry?  Maybe some oysters or {{foods->$aphro}} would
better suit you?  They say that {{$aphro}} are natural aphrodisiacs, you
know...

{{$girl}}: No, thank you.  I think I'm just going to go home.  It's been...
fun.

Prince {{$boy}}: Ah.  Well, I guess I'll have to imprison you then.  Guards!

{{$girl}} (drawing a large, {{adjective}} sword): HA!  Your {{nouns}}
can't help you now!  I will {{verb}} you!

Prince {{$boy}}: Oh no, you're--

{{$girl}}: THAT'S RIGHT!  I'm your father's secret assassin, and I was sent
here to kill you for being so {{adjective}}.

Prince {{$boy}}: Oh, sorry.  I thought you were the daughter of that farmer I
brutally {{verbed}} just last winter.  Carry on, then.

{{$girl}} (killing {{$boy}}): Right.  {{EXCLAMATION}}!!



And so the prince was killed, and {{$girl}}, who was really a secret spy for
{{place}} and not the king's assassin (for the king had no such assassin),
lived {{adverb}} ever after.
